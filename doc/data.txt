Types:
0 - Floors
1 - Bungalow
2 - Twin Floors

Representation: One-hot encoding (no ordinal relationship between the data)
The same as having three binary variables: isFloors, isBungalow, isTwinFloors
So:
1 = [1, 0, 0]
2 = [0, 1, 0]
3 = [0, 0, 1]

Construction Year:
Representation: Time since construction
Normalization
So, for example:
1950 = 74 years = 1
2024 = 0 years = 0

Number of Bedrooms:
Normalization, as the relationship is clear and ordinal
So:
2 = 0
5 = 1

Bathrooms:
Normalization
So:
1 = 0
3 = 1

Area:
Normalization, as there is a clear and ordinal relationship
So:
3000 = 0
10000 = 1

Garage:
No garage: 0
Garage: 1

Renovations:
0 = None
1 = Partial
2 = Total
Representation: One-hot encoding (there is an ordinal relationship, but it's not clear, so total != 2x partial)
So:
No renovations: [1, 0, 0]
Partial renovations: [0, 1, 0]
Total renovations: [0, 0, 1]

Output:
Normalization
100k = 0
1M = 1
